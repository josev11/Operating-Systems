The kernel is what connects the system hardware to the application software. 
The kendel is found in every type of operationg system.
It is what loads first when turning on a compuret and stays in the main memory.
We don't want the kendle to be overwritten by other programs, so it is loaded into a protected part of the memory.
Operating systems include a couple of power options.
I will only talk about the Sleep mode.
The Sleep mode stops all actions, and saves any open documents into the RAM.
Sleep mode puts the computer into a low-power state.
User interface (UI) is what we use to communicate or interact with computers.
This is where we enter instructions by selecting the different option on a menu.
The goal of the UI is suppose to make it easier for us to control.
